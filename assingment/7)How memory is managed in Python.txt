Python uses an automatic memory management system. This means the programmer does not
need to manually allocate or free memory. Memory management in Python is handled by the
Python Memory Manager, which ensures efficient use of memory during program execution.
Stack Memory
Stack memory is used to store function calls, local variables, and references to objects. It follows
the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Stack memory is fast and is automatically cleared when a
function ends.
Heap Memory
Heap memory is used to store actual objects such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and class
objects. Heap memory is larger than stack memory and is managed internally by Python.
Reference Counting
Python uses reference counting as its primary memory management technique. Each object keeps
a count of how many references point to it. When the reference count becomes zero, the object is
removed from memory automatically.
Garbage Collection
To handle circular references, Python uses garbage collection. Python follows generational
garbage collection, where objects are divided into generations based on their lifespan to improve
performance.
Conclusion
Python manages memory efficiently using stack memory, heap memory, reference counting, and
garbage collection. This automatic memory management system simplifies programming and
reduces errors.
