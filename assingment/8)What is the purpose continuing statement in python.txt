The continue statement in Python is used inside loops to skip the current iteration and move to the
next iteration of the loop. When the continue statement is executed, the remaining code inside the
loop for that iteration is ignored, and the loop continues with the next cycle.
The continue statement is mainly used when a programmer wants to skip certain values or
conditions without breaking the loop completely.
Working of Continue Statement
When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the control immediately jumps back to
the beginning of the loop for the next iteration. It does not terminate the loop but only skips the
current execution step.
Advantages of Continue Statement
1. It helps in skipping unwanted values.
2. It improves code readability.
3. It avoids the use of complex conditional statements.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue
with the next iteration. It is useful when certain conditions need to be ignored while keeping the loop
running.
