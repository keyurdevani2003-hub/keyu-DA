Negative indexes are used in Python to access elements of a sequence such as a list, tuple, or
string from the end. Instead of starting from the beginning (index 0), negative indexing starts
from the last element.
In negative indexing, -1 refers to the last element, -2 refers to the second last element, -3 refers
to the third last element, and so on.
Example:
a = [10, 20, 30, 40]
a[-1] → 40
a[-2] → 30
